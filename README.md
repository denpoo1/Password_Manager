# Password Maanger Console Application

Welcome to the realm of data security, Password Manager  ‚Äì a console application written in C++. This project provides unique capabilities for file encryption using a personalized encryption method developed by you. But that's not all ‚Äì the project also includes an intelligent algorithm capable of assessing password complexity and generating a robust new password to safeguard your data.

## Features ü™Ñ

- Personalized Encryption: Utilize your unique encryption method to ensure maximum security for your files. Password Manager allows you to tailor encryption parameters to meet your specific requirements.

- Password Complexity Algorithm: The built-in intelligent algorithm analyzes proposed passwords and provides feedback on complexity. Receive recommendations for creating strong and secure passwords, effectively protecting your data.

- Secure Password Generator: Don't want to devise complex passwords on your own? Password Manager offers a convenient generator that creates passwords using high-quality cryptographic methods.

- User-Friendly Interface: Manage and interact with the application through an intuitive console interface. Simple commands make it easy to encrypt, decrypt files, and configure security settings.


## Deployment üñ•Ô∏è

Compilation:
- Open the terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to the directory where your main.cpp file is located. Then, execute the compilation command

```bash
  g++ main.cpp -o my_program
```

Execution:
- Now, to run your console application, execute the command

```bash
  ./my_program
```

- If you are using Windows, the command might look something like

```bash
  my_program.exe
```

Expected Output:

- You should see the output terminal commands in the console.
